# Bone Layer State transformer
BLST is a deep learning project for bone state recognition, it includes deep learning and machine learning models. specific models implemented in this project are carefully discussed in our paper.


## Usage

1. Install Python 3.8. For convenience, execute the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtain the well-pre-processed datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15F3hR6r5ZJPdAW-rOF8wU-zJQlkNLmZT/view?usp=drive_link), Then place the downloaded data under the folder `dataset` which is made outside the project.
~~~
    -- project_folder
    -- dataset
~~~
3. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment script under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as follows:

```
bash ./scripts/bone_drill/test_one.sh
```
4. Train ML algorithms like SVM and KNN, directly run the file by Jupyter notebook
